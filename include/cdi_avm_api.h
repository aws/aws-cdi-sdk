 * @section avm_intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * The Cloud Digital Interface Audio, Video and Metadata (CDI_AVM) is the library which implements the
   low-latency reliable transport of audio, video and metadata between EC2 instances within the Amazon network.
 *
 * @section avm_high_level_arch CDI-AVM Architecture Overview
 *
 * The diagram shown below provides an overview of the CDI-AVM Transmit/Receive architecture.
 *
 * @image html "high_level_architecture.jpg"
 *
 * @section ec2_usage_avm CDI-AVM EC2 Instance Workflow Example
 *
 * The diagram shown below provides an example of using the CDI-AVM API on multiple EC2 instances and multiple TX/RX
 * connections. Each connection supports multiple video, audio and ancillary data streams that are identified by a
 * "stream_identifier" as defined in the API.
 *
 * @image html "avm_ec2_usage_example.jpg"
 *
 * @section avm_main_api CDI-AVM Application Programming Interface (API)
 *
 * The API is declared in: @ref cdi_avm_api.h
 *
 * The diagram shown below provides an example of the typical CDI-AVM TX/RX workflow using the CDI-AVM API.
 *
 * @image html "avm_api_workflow.jpg"
 *
 * The AVM interface of the CDI SDK is intended mainly for interoperabilty among vendors while remaining extensible.
 * To better encourage interoperability, a constrained set of audio, video, and ancillary data formats is supported.
 * Audio, for example, is always 24 bit linear PCM in big endian format. Ancillary data follows IETF RFC 8331. Video
 * similarly has a narrow set of supported parameters. Together, these comprise the CDI baseline profile.
 *
 * Extensibility is addressed through a generic configuration mechanism which is used even for the CDI baseline
 * profile. It is based on a structure containing a URI and optional parameter data. The URI is defined such that it
 * ensures uniqueness and optionally points to documentation on how to interpret the parameter data. The format of the
 * payload data is also dependent on the URI. Helper functions ease the process of creating and parsing the generic
 * configuration structure for the CDI baseline profile.
 *
 * The URIs used for the CDI baseline profile are:
 * https://cdi.elemental.com/specs/baseline-audio
 * https://cdi.elemental.com/specs/baseline-video
 * https://cdi.elemental.com/specs/baseline-ancillary-data
 *
 * The documents at those URIs fully specify the various aspects of each media type including the parameter data and the
 * in memory representation of payload data. These files also reside in CDI_SDK/doc/specs.
 *
 * Since the media format details are specificated outside of the SDK, new formats (beyond the CDI baseline profile)
 * can be added without changing the SDK. They can be publicly documented or they can remain private for situations
 * where interoperability is not required.
